<h2>Summary</h2
____________________________________________________________________  
  
 This project follows the project: "New Sheriff In Town."  In this project, we give the domain controller, also known as "Sheriff DC" the chance to run Active Directory or "AD." The gag is that AD has to be turned on like the switches on a circuit breaker, this helps the admin control all aspects of the domain. This will be demonstrated below.....
